old-things
=======================

A catalogue of old simulations/assignments for an unnamed really-hard physics course

Uploading these since the course is over now..




matrixfun: when the teacher tells us to perform a regression of points using Vandermonde matrices without teaching us exactly how to do it... This implements regular matrix operations, along with a recursive nxn determinant solver(September 2013) (C++)

elastic-balls: 2D simulation of elastic collisions with round balls that behave according to Hooke's law (10-08-2013 to 10-12-2013) (Java gui, C++ nogui)

coilfield: 3D simulation of magnetic field vectors using vectorized Biot-savart law and 2 Heimholtz coils (12-16-2013 to 12-16-2013) (Java, Matlab scripts)

extract.py: python script for extracting data from .cmbl and .qmbl files from LabPro data into csv, which are xml-based
